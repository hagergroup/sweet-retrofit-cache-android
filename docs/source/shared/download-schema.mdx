Apollo Android requires your GraphQL server's schema as a `schema.json` file. You can obtain the contents of this file by running an introspection query on your server.

**Note**: If you don't have a GraphQL server yet, you can use the server from the [tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/tutorial/00-introduction/): https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/graphql.

The Apollo Gradle plugin exposes a `downloadApolloSchema` task to help you obtain your schema. Provide this task your server's GraphQL endpoint and the output location for the `schema.json` file:

```bash:title=(shell)
./gradlew downloadApolloSchema \
  --endpoint="https://your.domain/graphql/endpoint" \
  --schema="src/main/graphql/com/example/schema.json"
```

If your GraphQL endpoint requires authentication, you can pass custom HTTP headers:

```bash:title=(shell)
./gradlew downloadApolloSchema \
  --endpoint="https://your.domain/graphql/endpoint" \
  --schema="app/src/main/graphql/com/example" \
  --header="Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
